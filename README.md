# VQA
Dense Co-Attention

Given an image and a natural language question, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Worked on attention based
Visual Question Answering which is the current state-of-the art model and further implement a hierarchical question co-attention on
VQA dataset using pytorch.


This repo will soon be revisited and a proper guidance for running the code will be provided.

# Dataset 
VQA 1.0 is used to train the Dense Co-Attention
